No two people have the same needs, so our software should be designed in a way that anyone can use it.

* The most important thing is well-structured HTML
* Manage cursor and focus
* Use a screen reader to test pages
* Aria should only need to be used for a small number of cases when HTML structure isnâ€™t enough
* Adhere to Level AA compliance as defined by the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AA-Conformance)
* Accessibility testing is handled during the QA process using the [Axe](https://www.deque.com/axe/) browser extension
