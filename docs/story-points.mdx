title: Story Points
---

We use a Fibonacci scale for story points when we size stories during sprint planning. These values roughly have the following meaning / definition:

:::note
Yes, we understand that we are committing a mortal sin here by (even loosely) equating story points to time value references, but ... whatever
:::

* **0** - Tasks of this size should typically take less than a couple of hours to complete.
* **1** - Tasks of this size should typically take roughly one half of a business day to complete
* **2** - Tasks of this size will typically take roughly one business day to complete
* **3** - Tasks of this size will typically take roughly two to three business days to complete
* **5** - Tasks of this size will typically take roughly three to four business days to complete
* **8** - Tasks of this size should typically take one developer no longer than one full sprint to complete. If there is any concern that it could potentially take longer than that, then most of the time it will likely be able to be broken down into smaller, independent tasks.
