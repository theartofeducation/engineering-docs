## Quality Assurance

**We’re glad you’re here!**

This guide is an effort to introduce the current Quality Assurance process and the tools in place. This is a living document that will change and grow as our department and processes develop.

What is Quality Assurance? Why is it important?
*Quality is generally transparent when present, but easily recognized in its absence.
~ Alan Gillies*

The title “Quality Assurance” is a bit of a misnomer. It implies that quality is something that we bring to the product being tested. A more accurate description is that we “assess risk”. We approach the product from every direction possible to find the flaws that our clients will eventually discover if they aren’t identified through the release phases. We are the doubters, investigators, ethical hackers, and the first time users of the product. We take full ownership and we delight in doing so. We find what’s wrong so it can be made right.

**Where Do I Start?**

Great question!
First, read the [Software Engineering Handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GrXqaVcmZB3Iga_KVICKeawf9-4oL2ai0NR3stsgNDU/edit#heading=h.kwmjf2rbjxk9) to understand the thinking behind our process.

**Next, let’s look at the tools:**

[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/my-drive):
This is your home. This is where you can find any resource related to [Quality Assurance](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1UzIgRbdoECb4EP0lyGDGdeXzzRxg2U3W) resources, [Software Engineering](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0AH-YqCSPGnyZUk9PVA), or [AOEU](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0APRl2e8Xicy6Uk9PVA). Don’t have access to a Drive that you need? Reach out to the [Tech Team](https://theartofed.slack.com/admin/user_groups) by using [this form.](https://share.hsforms.com/1ggldZBzoTQadzLupUqnxdg17zi9)

[Shortcut](https://shortcut.com/):
We’ll talk more on this later. For now, this is our Project Management tool where we track work, velocity, and capture future functionality or defects.

[Qase.io](https://app.qase.io/projects):
Qase is the Test Case Management system where we store test plans, create test cases, use Test Runs to track test time, create defects, and utilize reports that we can share with the organization.

[TestCafe](https://testcafe.io/):
This is the end-to-end automation framework we use to re-create the test case scenarios captured in Qase. TestCafe is an easy-to-learn, well documented framework that is part of our Software Development process.

[Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/):
Cypress is an additional automation framework. For our purpose, it exposes the API and we use it to automate API functionality.

[Slack](https://slack.com/):
This is the communication tool used throughout the company. Throughout your onboarding process, you’ll be exposed to the different channels and how to reach different teams. The main channels for anything related to Software Engineering is the #softwareengineering and the #productmanagement.

**A few other Resources:**

Environments:
Production Site: [https://theartofeducation.edu/](https://theartofeducation.edu/)
Acceptance Site: [https://theartofeducation.dev/](https://theartofeducation.dev/)

[Retrium](https://www.retrium.com/):
This is the space where we have retros, discuss Workplace Happiness, and any point of interest that benefits the team as a whole.

[EggHead.io](https://egghead.io/):
Each member of the software development team receives an account to increase their skill set and continue in the pursuit of Lifelong Learning

Got Questions?
If you have any questions about any resource provided here, a great place to ask is the #softwareengineering channel in Slack. If we don’t know the answer, we’ll find someone who will.
