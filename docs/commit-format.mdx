title: Git Commit Formatting
---

For all of our JavaScript/UI projects/repositories, we are using [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/), combined with [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky) `commit-msg` hooks to ensure that our git commits are properly formatted. We do this to help ensure a clean, consistent history of commits in our repositories, and because it can help us to automate the process of generating `CHANGELOG.md` files and incrementing package versions (using the [Semantic Versioning (semver) standard](https://semver.org/)) in a consistent and repeatable manner using tools like [Conventional Changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog), [Standard Version](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/standard-version) and [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/).

Commitlint expects git commit messages to be formatted in a specific manner based on known conventions that tools like Conventional Changelog and Standard Version can use for determining things like how to format the output of updates to `CHANGELOG` files, and how to apply a version update to the project/package. We use [the conventional commitlint configuration](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-conventional) which supports the following commit message prefixes:

* `build` - changes that impact the build process
* `ci` - changes that impact the continuous integration process
* `chore` - general house-keeping type chores
* `docs` - documentation additions and updates
* `feature` - new features
* `fix` - bug fixes
* `perf` - performance enhancements
* refactor` - changes that refactor existing code
* `revert` - reverts to previous commits
* `style` - styling (Sass/CSS) changes
* `test` - unit/integration testing changes
* `wip` - work in progress commits

## Examples

### Good

```
feature: added a new component
```

```
test(ch123): added unit tests for some functionality
```

☝🏼 In this example, "ch123" is a reference to a Story/Card in [Clubhouse](https://app.clubhouse.io/aoeu-se).

```
fix(sis): fixes ch456
```

☝🏼 In this example, after the "type" prefix, you can include, in parentheses, a reference to a specific feature or portion of the app, in this case, "sis". There are no specific rules to what can be put in the parentheses in cases like this.

### Bad

```
Added a new component
```

☝🏼 This commit message is missing a "type" prefix

```
please work
```

☝🏼 This is not only improperly formatted, but also not helpful

## GitMojis

If you feel like having a little fun with your commit messages, you can add emojis to them with the following codes that correspond to the commit type prefixes:

* 🔨 `build` - `:hammer:`
* ♻️ `ci` - `:recycle:`
* ☑️ `chore` - `:white_check_mark:`
* 📝 `docs` - `:pencil:`
* ✨ `feature` - `:sparkles:`
* 🐛 `fix` - `:bug:`
* ⚡️ `perf` - `:zap:`
* 🔧`refactor` - `:wrench:`
* 🙈 `revert` - `:see_no_evil:`
* 🎨 `style` - `:art:`
* ✅ `test` - `:white_check_mark:`
* 🚧 `wip` - `:construction:`

An example commit message using this would look like:

```sh
git commit -m "docs: :pencil: updated README"
```

Go on, have a little fun with it, you know you want to. 😆 [More GitMojis can be found here](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/).
