Code reviews are an important part of the SDLC and code quality. Code reviews serve several purpose:

* Ensure consistent style and standards.
* Help find possible issues before they are released.
* Provide optimization suggestions.
* Help with knowledge transfer amongst the team.

All Pull Requests will only be merged after passing the QA process and having 2 approved reviews from developers that did not contribute to the PR.
