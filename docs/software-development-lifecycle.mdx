title: Software Development Lifecycle
---

In general, an engineer should have a WIP (work in progress) limit of 1 story at a time (**In Development** through **Complete**). The engineer claims ownership of that story through the entire development cycle.

> Library projects do not have a `develop` branch and feature branches will be merged directly into `main`. This breaks the automation in Clubhouse and those cards will need to be moved manually.

1. Ready For Development
    * These are stories that are ready to be worked on
    * All stories in this state should have story points
    * Stories in this state will be scheduled to be worked on during a current or future interation
    * When an engineer is ready for a new story they will take one from this column that is assigned to the current interation
    * Creating a Git branch referrencing the story ID will automatically move the story to the **In Development** column
1. In Development
    * These are stories that are actively being worked on by an engineer
    * An engineer should normally have no more than 1 story in this column at a time
1. QA (Quality Assurance)
    * Once an engineer has finished work on a story it is moved to the QA Ready column
    * The enginer opens a Pull Request from their feature branch into `develop`
      * This will move the card from **In Development** to **QA**
    * When testing, QA moves the card to the **QA Testing** column and will manually test the story and create the test cases that will define the automation work after the card is moved to **Accepted**
    * If QA finds issues they will add them to the story and move the card to the **Rejected** column
    * Once there are no issues related to the story, QA moves the card to the **QA Done** column
    * Once the Pull Request has approval from QA and the other requested developers it is merged into `develop` and automatically moved to the **Acceptance** column
1. Acceptance
    * When a working branch is merged into `develop` a build will start for an acceptance server
    * The Product Team will evaluate stories in this column to ensure the implementation meets the requirements
    * If a story does not meet the requirements Product will move the card to **Rejected** and add details
    * Once a story meets the requirements, Product will move the card to **Accepted** to indicate it is ready for production release
1. Accepted
    * These cards have been identified by the Product Team as ready for production release
    * The responsible engineer will open a Pull Request to merge `develop` into `main`
    * Once the Pull Request has the required approvals, the engineer will merge the request and start a production build
    * Once the story has been merged into `main`, it is automatically moved to the **Completed** column
1. Rejected
    * These cards have been identified by QA or the Product Team as not meeting the story requirements
    * The responsible engineer will move the card back into the **In Development** column and address the identified issues
    * The story follows the normal cycle starting from the **In Development** column
1. Complete
    * These cards are completed stories that have been pushed to production
