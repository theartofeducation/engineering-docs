title: Software Development Lifecycle
---

In general, an engineer should have a WIP (work in progress) limit of 1 story at a time (**In Development** through **Complete**). The engineer claims ownership of that story through the entire development cycle.

> Library projects do not have a `develop` branch and feature branches will be merged directly into `main`. This breaks the automation in [Shortcut](https://shortcut.com/) and those cards will need to be moved manually.

1. Backlog
    * This is the default column
    * Stories that need more information or planning before development work will be added or moved here
    * When a story has been deemed ready it will be moved to **Ready For Development**
1. Ready For Development
    * These are stories that are ready to be worked on by engineering
    * All stories in this state should have story points
    * When an engineer is ready for a new story they will take one from this column this column and assign it to the current iteration
    * Creating a Git branch referrencing the story ID will automatically move the story to the **In Development** column
1. In Development
    * These are stories that are actively being worked on by an engineer
    * An engineer should normally have no more than 1 story in this column at a time
1. QA Ready
    * Once an engineer has finished work on a story it is moved to the QA Ready column
    * The enginer opens a Pull Request from their feature branch into `develop`
      * This will move the card from **In Development** to **QA Ready**
    * If a card has the **No QA** label it is manually moved directly to **QA Done**
1. QA Testing
    * When a QA engineer starts testing a story, they will move the card to this column
    * The QA engineer will manually test the story
    * The QA engineer will write automated tests for the story
        * A branch with the same name as the feature branch will be created in the QA E2E repo
    * If QA finds issues they will add them to the story and move the card to the **Rejected** column
    * Once there are no issues related to the story and automated tests are complete, QA moves the card to the **QA Done** column
1. QA Done
    * Cards in this column have passed QA and have automated tests written for it
    * Once the Pull Request has approval from QA and the other requested developers it is merged into `develop` and automatically moved to the **Acceptance** column
1. Acceptance
    * When a working branch is merged into `develop` a build will start for an acceptance server
    * The Product Team will evaluate stories in this column to ensure the implementation meets the requirements
    * If a story does not meet the requirements Product will move the card to **Rejected** and add details
    * Once a story meets the requirements, Product will move the card to **Accepted** to indicate it is ready for production release
    * If a card has the **No ACC** label it is manually moved directly to **Accepted**
1. Accepted
    * These cards have been identified by the Product Team as ready for production release
    * The responsible engineer will open a Pull Request to merge `develop` into `main`
    * Once the Pull Request has the required approvals, the engineer will merge the request and start a production build
    * Once the story has been merged into `main`, it is automatically moved to the **Completed** column
1. Rejected
    * These cards have been identified by QA or the Product Team as not meeting the story requirements
    * The responsible engineer will move the card back into the **In Development** column and address the identified issues
    * The story follows the normal cycle starting from the **In Development** column
1. Complete
    * These cards are completed stories that have been pushed to production
