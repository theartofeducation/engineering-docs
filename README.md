# AoEU Template Repo

![CI](https://github.com/theartofeducation/template-repo/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=main)

This is a template repo all AoEU repos should start with.

## How To Use This Template

1. Go to the "Create a new repository" page on GitHub
1. Select this repo as the template in the "Repository template" field
1. Check the "Include all branches" box
1. Select "theartofeducation" as the "Owner" of the repository
1. Add the repository name
1. Add a short description for the repository
1. Select "Public" or "Private" as appropriate for the repository
1. Click the "Create repository" button
1. Update files and repository information as needed
1. Once your repo is setup rebase `develop` on `main` and force push to the `origin`
    * This ensures that `develop` is based on `master` so when you create a PR in
     the future GitHub will allow it
